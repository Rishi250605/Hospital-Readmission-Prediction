# Predictive Modeling for Hospital Readmission Risk

## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of unplanned patient readmissions in the healthcare industry. Unplanned readmissions, defined as a patient being admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, are a significant concern as they may indicate gaps in patient care and contribute to increased financial and operational burdens for hospitals.

## Problem Statement

High hospital readmission rates can result from premature discharge, inadequate patient understanding of post-discharge instructions, or insufficient support at home. These factors can negatively impact patient outcomes and strain hospital resources, leading to overcrowding, staff burnout, and disruption of scheduled procedures.

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital. This predictive tool aims to enable healthcare providers to proactively identify high-risk patients and intervene early, thereby improving patient care and optimizing hospital resource allocation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:  
[Hospital Readmissions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions?resource=download)
